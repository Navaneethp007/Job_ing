# 1. Description of the project
   The present era is becoming the startup era which is one of the best things that could happen. But the problem is that many startups just fail due to a lack of employees/lack of good investors. Unemployment is also one of the greatest issues seen in the world. Almost 75% of the people are unemployed because they don't have experience and the right kind of exposure.

The idea is to help and support startups through my app which in turn solves the above-mentioned problem statement. The unemployment issue due to lack of experience can be resolved by getting to work at a startup since it is the best place to improve your potential and experience in the best way.The app provides a platform to let startup owners find the right investors and employees who are registered through the app. It also provides investors an opportunity to invest in a startup whose idea they like. It provides a platform for employees to apply from a wide variety of startups.
